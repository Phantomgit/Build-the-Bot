# Basic Bot Build

Note: This bot is published as it is no longer under active development and is not being maintained by a member of the Watson Combat Robotics League Executive Board. The bot and all files are provided "as-is" and will not be updated in the future.

The components may or may not be accurate, and the bot itself may not be competition worthy. We provided these files in a .3mf format so they can be opened up in your CAD software or 3D printer slicer of choice and can serve as a reference or inspiration in your designs/builds.

Happy building!
